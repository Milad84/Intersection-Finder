## Description

The Street Intersection Finder is a Python script designed to simplify geospatial analysis by allowing users to identify streets that intersect with a target street within a given shapefile. It is particularly useful for urban planning, GIS, or any application where you need to find streets that share common boundaries.

The script utilizes the Geopandas library to work with geospatial data and offers two methods for selecting the target street: by name or by specifying its coordinates.

## Features

- Search for intersecting streets by street name or geometry.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Utilizes Geopandas for efficient geospatial operations.
- Easily customizable and extendable.
